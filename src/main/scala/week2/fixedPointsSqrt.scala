// A number x is called a fixed point of a function f if f maps x to itself

// initial estimate and then by applying f in a repetitive way until value
// does not vary anymore (or the change is sufficiently small).
// x, f(x), f(f(x)), f(f(f(x))), ...

// Doesnâ€™t work for all functions, but works for quite a few such as sqrt.

//def sqrtFirstTry(x: Double): Double = fixedPoint(y => x / y)(1.0)
// sqrtFirstTry(2) does not converge. Instead it oscillates between 1.0 and 2.0 :(

// One way to control such oscillations is to prevent the estimation
// from varying too much. This is done by average successive values
// of the original sequence.

// For sqrt, it is the avg of previous value y and the new value x / y
def sqrtAvgDamp(x: Double): Double = fixedPoint(y => (y + x / y) / 2)(1.0)

// being abstracted into its own function
